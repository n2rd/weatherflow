To build this, you will need the following hardware:

Optional 3D printed stand. You can download the desing files (STL) from https://learn.adafruit.com/pages/15661/elements/3024132/download?type=zip and print them yourself or using a printing service such as CraftCloud3D https://craftcloud3d.com. I used this service and the stand cost just $6 (plus $6 shipping. I bough a few sets for the same shipping cost).
